# About me

Hi,

I'm [Gopal Verma](https://x.com/bettercallgopal), an indie developer, freelancer, and full-stack developer based in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India).
I do open-source projects and freelance work. Visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/gopalverma1303) or [book a call](/#)!

#### <u>Childhood</u>

> Year 2013

My first encounter with computer programming was through [Visual Basic 6.0](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-bas/60). My teacher showed me how to create a simple program that changed the background color to <span className="text-red-500">red</span> when a button was clicked. This made me excited, as I could now **create things that other people could use.** I was so excited that I remembered how to create the form and the button but didn't remember `what he had written inside it.`

After the lecture was over, I got the software on my pendrive and took it home. After [school](https://dpshardwar.com/), I installed the software at home and tried to recreate the program. I remembered how to draw the form but didn't remember what to write in the command button. So I typed out a `command`: 

```vb
private Sub Command1_Click()
  "When I click on you, change the background to red."
End Sub
```

And, clicked the command button, took a step back, and waited for the magic to occur. I encountered the first error of my life that day. That day I learned that this `sh*t` isn't going to be as simple as it looks.

However, because my desire to create something people wanted outweighed the comfort of staying in my comfort zone, I made the decision to fully commit to computer programming and related pursuits.

#### <u>Teenage</u>

> Year 2015 - 2017

After `VB`, I learned about `SQL`, `C`, `C++`, `Java`, and `Python`. `C++` became my favourite because of its performace and extensive libraries and tools for game dev. 
The `<math.h>` and `<graphics.h>` libraries were my favorites, and,  [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) being my my go-to tool.

> Year 2018 - 2020

Age of new tools for me. Upgraded from MS-DOS to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and `Python` begin my new favourite. 
Tinkered with it. Created a couple of projects using `SQL` and `Flask`.

#### <u>College Life</u>

> Year 2021 - 2025

Many people, including my clients, often inquire why I chose to pursue a BE course in production and industrial engineering alongside a BS in DS and Computer Programming, despite the apparent disparity between the two fields.

I chose to study production and industrial engineering alongside computer programming because I believe the combination offers a diverse skill set and broad career opportunities in technology and engineering.

Production and industrial engineering bring expertise in operation research and management, optimizing processes, systems, and manufacturing operations, while computer programming offers the ability to develop software solutions, automate tasks, and analyze data, collectively enhancing efficiency, innovation, and problem-solving in various industries.

I learned about `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` in the initial days. And gradually, moved towards more powerful frameworks and libraries.
